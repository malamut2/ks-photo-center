# ksPhotoCenter
A Desktop Picture Viewer, Image Library, and Photo Editor,
designed for quick and easy workflow.

## Purpose
We aim to provide hobby photographers with a single tool
which meets all of their needs in most cases, and which does not
get into the way. The tool should give us:

1. A picture Viewer which allows for fast scrolling through images,
especially in full screen view mode, and which lets us print images
in a user-friendly way.
2. An Image Library which allows for organization in folders,
by time, and/or location, as well as for free-text searches.
The library must not get in the way for people who decide to not
include all pictures there.
All other functionality of the software should be available regardless
of whether the respective picture is in the library. 
3. A photo editor with basic but fast and useful editing functions,
including tagging, entering of titles, the typical lighting, rotate,
mirror, and crop functions, basic drawing, and creation of collages.
Editing will be strictly non-destructive. No exceptions.

This might sound a bit like Picasa, and that's no coincidence.
As we started development of ksPhotoCenter, we have been active
users of Picasa, although the software does have its shortcomings,
and it has been out of life for many years now. If we can in the
end offer a few users of Picasa an open source alternative which they
like even better, mission will be accomplished.

## Current status
This software is in early incubation phase. We are far away from
releasing anything, not even strongly feature-incomplete alphas.
Please visit us again later.

## Product Roadmap
Here are lists of what has been done already, and what we
currently plan to do.

### Already done
1. Nothing. :)  Please return later.

### Next Steps
1. Create minimum viable picture viewer.
2. Provide a first pre-release with at least a Windows Executable or
Installable, preferably also with other platforms, and a platform
independent installable.
3. Create minimum viable library.
4. Create Edit Mode with metadata controls and very most basic
image editing controls.
5. Add control for multiple selection, which shall be basis for
collages and printing.
